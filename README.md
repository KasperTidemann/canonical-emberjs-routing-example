# Canonical Ember.js routing example

-------------------------

Ember.js is on the rise with more and more people embracing the framework for creating client-side web applications. The community is focusing heavily on the development these days, making changes and commits on an hourly basis.

A couple of days ago, routing was moved out of `Ember.State` and into `Ember.Route`, paving the way for new routing examples based on the latest conventions. Alas, I bring you my canonical routing example using Ember.js:

First of all, I have put up [a live version of the example code here](http://www.kaspertidemann.com/examples/canonical-emberjs-routing-example/ "a live version of the example code here").

Now, the example consists of an `index.html` file containing trivial HTML plus the Handlebars templates used. All JavaScript files reside in the `js/` folder. Finally, for the CoffeeScript lovers, there is an `app.coffee` file in the `src/` folder.

Should you wish to download the example files, I have [a ZIP file available right here](http://www.kaspertidemann.com/examples/canonical-emberjs-routing-example/CanonicalRoutingExampleUsingEmberJS.zip "a ZIP file available right here").

I did my best to comment everything, including the use of `Em.run.next()` for making the effects work on the initial load. If you have any questions, please let me know or join us at `#emberjs` on [irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org "irc.freenode.org"). Enjoy!
